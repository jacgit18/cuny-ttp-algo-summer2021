Problem Statement #

You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all 
the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, 
one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in 
the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss 
of another number.

You are given an integer array nums representing the data 
status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is
 missing and return them in the form of an array.

Control flow(Break, Continue) based on defined steps & edge cases

    Simple Test case: Rules:
     ---------------------------------------------
      new customer -> 15% off
      repeat customer -> 10% off
      coupon customer -> 30% off

     num of test case = num of rules = 2^num of conditions = 2^3 = 8 rules

     n = not likely p = probably
     Identify commonalities between test case
     Follow Discrete math De-Morgan's Law
     new cus T T T T F F F F
