Initial Edgecase Param()

In sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9x9 board with digits so that each column, each row, 
and each of the nine 3x3

 board contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
 
 The board setter provides a partially completed board, 
 
well-posed board has a unique solution. 
 As explained above, for this problem, it suffices to calculate whether a given sudoku board has a solution.
 No need to return the actual numbers that make up a solution.
 
 set 
 
 sub grid 3X3 with unique nums is solution
 . represent blank spaces
 
 function should fill the blank spaces with characters such that the following rules apply:

Return

Control flow(Break, Continue) based on defined steps & edge cases

    Simple Test case: Rules:
     ---------------------------------------------
      new customer -> 15% off
      repeat customer -> 10% off
      coupon customer -> 30% off

     num of test case = num of rules = 2^num of conditions = 2^3 = 8 rules

     n = not likely p = probably
     Identify commonalities between test case
